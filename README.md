PERSONAL NOTES:
So far, I relied on XTerm and MATE terminal emulators as those being default under Linux. However, there are much more faster emulators avaible. I bet on Alacritty, GPU accelerated terminal emulator, althrough simple RXVT terminal also seems to be a solid choice. Avoid XTerm and MATE at all cost.
